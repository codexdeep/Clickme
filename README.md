# Neon “CLICK ME” button that refuses to be clicked
A glossy neon “CLICK ME” button that sprints away whenever the cursor gets close. Part prank, part patience trainer, all vibes 😈💨 Perfect for demos, easter eggs, and “can’t click this” moments.
A minimalist, single‑file HTML/CSS/JS experiment where the button has commitment issues: approach it and it teleports to safety 😂✨ Includes footer credit for style points.
